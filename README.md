# Renny

A Discord bot that plays music in a voice channel, and much more functions will be added soon.

# **Requirements**
Run the following command to install the required packages for this bot:

For non-Window users, it is possible that the bot fails to work due to Opus not loaded, in that case, please install Opus:

# **Running the bot**
Replace the token in Launcher.py with the token of you bot, now you can run it and have fun.
